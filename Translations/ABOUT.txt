The basic256 project uses the QTranslator system for imternationalization.

The XML files .ts are created by the lupdate utility in QT.  In trunk run

lupdate BASIC256.pro

This will create and update the XML files that will contain all of the strings
in the program files.  New ones will be added, old ones will be marked as obsolete
and existing ones will still have their translations.

use the QT program

lingust

to maintain the xml files and to create the files with the .qm extensions.  The *.qm
files are compiled translation files that need to be installed in the Translations folder
of the executable.

To run BASIC256 with a translation file use the -l command line option followed by
the language code (de, sp, RU_ru...)
