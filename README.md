# BASIC-256

BASIC-256 is an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach anybody (especially middle and high-school students) the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto, which helps kids easily see how program flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming concepts through fun exercises.

This is my fork on BASIC-256 as I struggled getting in touch with original authors.

I keep this current with upstream, including original SVN history via GIT SVN.

## New features

- [x] `fmod` floating point modulo command
- [x] embedded translations no matter what
