	* VariableWin.cpp (addVar): Changed variable window to use TreeWidget instead of a list, to allow for showing arrays.

2006-11-28    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Changed variable window updates to only occur in debug mode.  Otherwise this is a severe performance hit for programs updating many variables in tight loops.

	* VariableWin.cpp (clearTable): Added Variable Watch window.

2006-11-26    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MainWindow.cpp (QMainWindow): Added two items to view menu to enable/disable text and graphics output windows.

2006-11-20    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Merged file ops and changed them to work more simply.
	  Changed array printing to print pointer address instead of int, which should fix the 64 bit compile problem.

2006-11-19    <fhendrikx@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added file operations "open", "read", "write", "close". The read and write functions work on a token basis. EOF is returned by returning an empty token.

	* Added code to test new functions "fileops1.kbs" (and 2 and 3). 

2006-11-17    <fhendrikx@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added string "length" function and sample code "length.kbs"

	* Added alternative spelling for "color" function: "colour"

	* Added "poly" function and sample code "polygon.kbs"

2006-11-07    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Fixed rather important memory allocation bug that affected large programs that used lots of if statements.

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Fixed bug 1589686

2006-11-03    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (compileProgram): Changed the way the interpreter keeps track of line numbers.  Now there's a CURRLINE bytecode which is executed every time the line changes. Also added step-by-step debugging.

2006-11-02    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Printing of floating point instead of integers fixed.

2006-11-01    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added OP_LINE, which draws lines.

2006-10-31    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added pause command

	* BasicEdit.cpp (cursorMove): Added slot to calculate line number when the cursor moves, and display it on the status bar.

2006-10-25    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Main.cpp (main): Added actions to edit menu.  Removed close button on output windows.

2006-10-20    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp: Added internationalization support.

	* BasicEdit.cpp: Added internationalization support.

	* Main.cpp (main): Added internationalization support.

2006-10-18    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BasicEdit.cpp (BasicEdit): Editor now won't accept rich text, fixing weird font bugs.

	* RunController.cpp (saveByteCode): Added saveByteCode function which saves the compiled byte code to a .kbc file.

	* Main.cpp (main): Added save byte code function and Advanced menu.

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Changed to more dynamic allocation of byteCode to reduce memory footprint for small programs and to prevent memory errors from occurring on 64-bit architectures.

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added mathematical functions FLOOR, CEIL, RAND, SIN, COS, TAN, and ABS
	Separated initialize from compileProgram to support saving byte code as a file.
	
2006-10-16    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added and, not, xor, and or operations

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Added AND, NOT, XOR, OR

	* LEX\basicParse.l: Added floor, ceil, int, str, and rand tokens

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Added arrays and string arrays.

	* Interpreter.h (struct variable): Added arrays and string arrays.

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added arrays and string arrays.

2006-10-11    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BasicGraph.cpp (keyPressEvent): Added keyPressEvent to set currentKey global variable whenever a key is pressed during run time.

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Added KEY keyword as floatexpr

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Added OP_KEY operation, which gets the last key pressed.

2006-10-09    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LEX\basicParse.y: Added colon as multiple statement separator

2006-10-07    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RunController.cpp (stopRun): Changed to threaded model.

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Changed to a threaded model.

	* BasicOutput.cpp (getInput): Added slot to support threading.

	* Interpreter.cpp (execByteCode): Changed from using QPixmaps for graphical output to QImage, which is thread-safe.

2006-10-06    <drblast@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Interpreter.cpp (pause): Removed unnecessary pause and unpause functions

	* RunController.cpp (pauseResume): Enabled Pause/Resume feature

	* PauseButton.h: Created Pause button which changes text based on operation 

	* Main.cpp (main): Removed Renumber Lines menu option
	(main): Pause/Resume button enabled
