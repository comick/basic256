Build Windows MINGW, LINUX, and MACX (g++):

  open a command window (cmd)
  type "make clean" and hit enter
  type "qmake BASIC256.pro -config debug" and hit enter
     - for MACX "qmake BASIC256.pro -spec macx-g++"
  type "make" and hit enter 
  
  You'll see an executable called BASIC256 either in this directory or in a "debug" directory, depending on your version of QT.

  linux:  "make install" will install translations, help and binary  You can then create a
      launcher to "BASIC256" or "BASIC256 -l locale".

  windows (observed under vista business sp2): make will not work because of Microsoft's command
      line length issue.  A possible work around would be to use 'msys'.  It gives a unix like
	 shell to work from without the problem.

Release Build (Windows):
  To build a nice WIN32 installer use the nullsoft scriptable install system file
  3.0 or better) called BASIC256.nsi.  You must build a release copy of BASCI256.
  
  Make sure the dll and library files are copied in the folders as above. 
  
  make clean
  qmake BASIC256.pro -config release
  make release 
  
  then run the NSIS script
  
Portable Build (Windows):
  This process will populate the BASIC256Portable folder so that the "PortableApps Installer 3.x"
  will be able to create the *.paf.exe file.
  
  BE SURE TO EDIT THE VERSION NUMBER IN trunk/BASIC256Portable/App/AppInfo/appinfo.ini
  before building the PAF file.

  ** TO BUILD THE Portable BINARY and complete the directory **
 
  delete all files and folders from trunk/BASIC256Portable/App/BASIC256
  BASIC256PortableSupportFileCopy.bat
  make clean
  qmake BASIC256Portable.pro -config release
  make release
