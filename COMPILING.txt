To compile, you'll need the open source version of QT4, GNU flex and bison.
Specifcally for LINUX you will need:
* espeak development libraries
* g++ compiler and base development libraries

Specifically for Windows you will need:
* mingw c++ compiler for Win32
* gtk win32 bundle headers and libraries from http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
* the gretl development headers need to be added to mingw they are in a file called mingw-extra.zip
  and can be found at http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

Build:

  open a command window (cmd)
  type "make clean" and hit enter
  type "qmake" and hit enter
  type "make" and hit enter 
  
  You'll see an executable called BASIC256 either in this directory or in a "debug" directory, depending on your version of QT.

Release Build (Windows):
  To build a nice WIN32 installer use the nullsoft scriptable install system file
  2.39 or better) called BASIC256.nsi.  You must build a release copy of BASCI256.
  
  You must also copy the QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll and mingwm10.dll to the release
  folder before testing the build or running the installer script.  Under QT 4.5.3
  be sure to use the dlls from C:\Qt\2009.04\qt\bin and not the ones from C:\Qt\2009.04\bin. 
  
  make clean
  qmake -config release
  make release 
  
  then run the NSIS script
