===== NetConnect =====

==== Format ====
**netconnect** //server_name//, //port_number//\\
**netconnect** ( //server_name//, //port_number// )\\
**netconnect** //socket_number//, //server_name//, //port_number//\\
**netconnect** ( //socket_number//, //server_name//, //port_number// )

==== Description ====
Open a network connection (client) to a server.  The IP address or host name of a server are specified in the //server_name// argument, and the specific network port number in the //port_number// argument.  If //socket_number// is not specified socket number zero (0) will be used.

==== Example ====
Open two instances of BASIC-256 on a single computer.  Paste the "server" code into one and the "client" code into the other.  Run the server first and the client second.  You can see how the messages are sent back and forth between the two different processes.

      print ".";
   end while
   n$ = netread
   print n$
   netwrite "I got '" + n$ + "'."
until n$ = "end"
netclose
